Those who deny the cognitive \\npenetrability thesis claim that the effect of cognitive states on perception is either \\npre-perceptual, determining, e.g., the spatial allocation of perceptual attention, or \\nelse is post-perceptual, determining, e.g., what beliefs one is disposed to form on the \\nbasis of perceptual experience (Pylyshyn, 1999).\\nBy way of illustration, consider the following: in experimental conditions, sub-\\njects who were led to believe that samples of meat originated from factory-farmed \\nanimals rated them as tasting saltier than did subjects who were led to believe that \\nidentical samples originated from humanely-farmed animals (Anderson & Barrett, \\n2016). Question: in the first group, did their belief that the meat samples were from \\nfactory farmed animals literally make the meat taste saltier than it would have oth-\\nerwise? Those who affirm the cognitive penetrability thesis reply ‘yes’, those who \\ndeny it claim ‘no’. The naysayers will reply that the belief about the meat’s origin \\neither altered how those in the first group allocated their gustatory attention, e.g., \\ncausing them to selectively pick up on properties that they wouldn’t have otherwise, \\nor else the belief induced by the experimenters disposed members of the group \\nto judge the samples particularly salty, with gustatory experience itself uniform \\nbetween the two groups.\\nLike the question of whether perception has high-level content, the question of \\nperception’s cognitive penetrability is controversial. Many experimental studies \\nadvanced as evidence of cognitive penetration seem poorly designed, either suffer -\\ning failures of replicability or else having been found vulnerable to interference or \\ntask-demand effects (Firestone & Scholl, 2016; Machery, 2015). Crucially, intro-\\nspective evidence is of little help to adjudicate matters here. Introspection lacks the \\nkeenness to distinguish cognition’s affecting either (1) the pre-perceptual alloca-\\ntion of attention; (2) perceptual content itself (i.e. cognitive penetration); (3) what \\n11 Compare Tim Bayne (2009, p. 395): “It does not matter what one believes about an object; it still \\nlooks like a pipe, a stethoscope, or a cigarette lighter.”.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'imagination.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='7213\\n1 3Synthese (2021) 199:7203–7230 \\nTye’s thought is that high-level properties, natural kinds in particular, are not repre-\\nsented by perception since our perceptual systems are not sensitive to their instantia-\\ntions, as they are the instantiations of low-level properties. Our visual systems are \\n“tuned” (p. 142) to the comings and goings of colour, shape, motion, etc. but not the \\ngenetic essences constitutive of natural kinds; visual phenomenology, in the normal \\ncourse of things, changes in the face of variations to the former but not the latter. \\nIndeed, it seems that one’s visual phenomenology would fail to differ between a sit-\\nuation in which tigers were before one’s eyes and a situation in which twigers were \\ninstead present. (Twigers, we may suppose, are creatures that happen to share\\xa0 all \\nlow-level properties with tigers while being a distinct species.) If this is right, then \\nobjects that are look-alikes in terms of low-level properties should be considered \\nlook-alikes simpliciter, leaving no room for high-level properties to figure in per -\\nceptual content. Again, however, this worry has no analogue in the case of mental \\nimagery that would prevent such states from representing high-level properties. I \\ntake this to be further evidence of a representational difference between the two.\\nHere’s why the worry doesn’t carry over to the imagination. In the case of per -\\nception, high-level properties are either represented in the same bottom-up, stimu-\\nlus-driven way that low-level properties like colour, shape, motion, etc. are, or (as is \\nmore likely) as a matter of cognitive penetration, i.e. a top-down effect of standing \\nbeliefs, desires, expectations, etc. on perception (more on that later). In either case, \\nhowever, perception comes to represent high-level properties in an involuntary man-\\nner. Although cognitive penetration involves acquired cognitive contents altering \\nperceptual contents, such effects on perception are largely automatic, involving an \\nunwilled ‘leaking’ of such contents into perception.9\\nWith states of the imagination, things are different. When Tye complains that the \\nvisual system is insufficiently ‘tuned’ to the genetic essence constitutive of natural \\nkinds in order to represent such properties, this is not a problem in the case of the \\nimagination. For, regardless of whether the imagination sometimes acquires content \\nfrom causal interactions with the environment in the bottom-up way that percep-\\ntion typically does, there is another manner by which the imagination can acquire \\ncontent, and which is unavailable to perception, at least in the case of representing \\nnatural kinds: by being responsive to one’s intention to represent such-and-such a \\nnatural kind. For instance, I can imagine two suitably-striped creatures side-by-side, \\nrepresent the creature on the left to be a tiger, the one on the right to be a twiger, \\nand then reverse this as I please. Similarly, I can imagine two glasses of clear liq-\\nuid next to one another, and represent one to be water, composed of  H2O, and the \\nother to be twater, composed of XYZ; I can again freely reverse this assignation as \\nI choose, or refrain from doing so. This might be thought to involve an accompany -\\ning propositional imagining acting on the image content, a form of imagining I have \\nclaimed can be put aside. However, given that the relevant propositional imagining \\nwould itself acquire content from a suitable\\xa0“content-conveying intention” (Noord-\\nhoff, 2002, p. 430), it is not clear why propositional imagining must be appealed to \\nhere and why intention shouldn’t be pictured as acting directly on imagery content.\\n9 An exception might be when mental imagery is voluntarily projected into perception, as in the driving \\nexample, though such projection can also occur involuntarily.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'imagination.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='7212 Synthese (2021) 199:7203–7230\\n1 3\\nsunny beach when the temperature is, in fact, in the minuses and the sky overcast. \\nThus, the\\xa0norms governing epistemic (and perhaps broader psychological) appropri-\\nateness differ quite radically across perception and imagination.\\nCrucially, even when imagery does aim to match one’s environment, a mismatch \\nbetween properties imaginatively represented and properties actually instantiated is \\nnot classified as an illusion. This is not the result that one should get, if percep-\\ntualism is true. For instance, suppose you are driving at night in foggy conditions \\nalong a narrow road. Thankfully, no other cars are out. Still, the route is precarious. \\nSuddenly, a car appears on the road. At least, you assume it to be one; all you can \\nvisually discern are two headlights. To work out whether there is space for the cars \\nto pass on the narrow lane, you must make an educated guess as to the shape of \\nthe other car, given the position of the headlights. But you need to do so in such a \\nway that can directly guide your action. Solution: you imaginatively project, out into \\nthe pitch-black, the outline shape of a car that strikes you as being the correct size. \\n(Whether this is a matter of representing only low-level properties, i.e. those corre-\\nsponding to the outline shape of the car, or is also or instead a matter of representing \\nhigh-level properties, i.e. the shape to be that of a car part, doesn’t matter.)\\nSuppose, however, that you get the proportions disastrously wrong (and so crash). \\nThen, the image projected was in error. The error is in terms of the properties your \\nmental imagery represented as instantiated in the external world. If imaginative \\nstates are of a kind with perceptual states, then this would be a case of illusion, or \\nat least something very close to it. Yet one would not speak here of a visual illusion \\nor of a mis-seeing of the car’s shape. (The problem was precisely that you couldn’t \\nvisually experience these properties!) Thus, supposing that there are no perceptual \\nillusions of high-level properties, this fact may threaten high-level views of percep-\\ntual content, but not high-level views of the imagination’s content (no more, at least, \\nthan the idea that belief can represent such properties). When imagery misrepresents \\nproperties in the world, as when belief misrepresents such properties, ‘illusion’ is \\nnot the word to begin with. Thus, populating the imagination with high-level content \\ndoes not, while populating perception with such content does, have relevance for the \\nscope of perceptual illusions. This shows a significant difference in the representa-\\ntional nature of perceptual experience and mental imagery.\\n3.2  Doppelgangers\\nAnother key reason for resisting the claim that perceptual experience has high-level \\ncontent, but which has no analogue in the case of mental imagery, concerns percep-\\ntual doppelgangers. This argument can be pressed a number of ways (Bayne, 2009 \\ndiscusses several variants). A simple version is presented by Michael Tye:\\nIt seems plausible to suppose that the property of being a tiger is not itself a \\nfeature represented [perceptually]. Our sensory states do not track this feature. \\nThere might conceivably be creatures other than tigers that look to us phenom-\\nenally just like tigers. (1995, p.141)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'imagination.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='7210 Synthese (2021) 199:7203–7230\\n1 3\\nIn fact, Byrne seems happy to populate states of the imagination with high-level \\ncontent of a fairly unrestricted sort, making imagination exceptionally close to belief \\nin its representational powers. He continues:\\n[O]ne may imagine the piano being made of ice, being the offspring of Mr. \\nand Mrs. Truman, turning into a butterfly and flying up the stairs, or whatever. \\n(Ibid.)\\n I will grant, for the sake of argument, Byrne’s assumption that the imagination has \\nhigh-level content.7 My strategy for arguing against perceptualism will be on the \\nbasis of some aspects of the high-level content debate itself.\\nThe argument from high-level content\\n1. If perceptualism is true, then putative grounds for denying that perceptual expe-\\nrience has high-level content are putative grounds for denying that states of the \\nimagination have high-level content.\\n2. Putative grounds for denying that perceptual experience has high-level content \\nare not putative grounds for denying that states of the imagination have high-level \\ncontent.\\n3. Perceptualism is not true.\\nI take 1 to be entailed by perceptualism. If states of the imagination are a proper \\nsubset of perceptual experience, then challenges facing a high-level view of percep-\\ntual content will, ipso facto, be challenges for a high-level view of the imagination’s \\ncontent. Whether those challenges are only prima facie or are instead sufficient \\ngrounds for rejecting the high-level view of perception won’t concern me. (Hence \\nI call them only putative grounds.) Premise 2 says that challenges to perception’s \\nhaving high-level content have no application to imagination’s having high-level \\ncontent. If true, this seems evidence of a substantial asymmetry between perception \\nand imagination, one that does not constitute a mere difference in degree, but a dif-\\nference in kind; specifically, it points to a difference in representational natures. The \\nconclusion is that perceptualism is false: states of the imagination, mental imagery \\nin particular, are not a subset of perceptual experience; the two are not on a\\xa0substan-\\ntial continuum with one another nor members of the same fundamental psychologi-\\ncal kind (though they may of course share many properties in common). In sum, I \\nargue below that challenges to perception’s having high-level content have no rel-\\nevance as to whether the imagination has high-level content, suggesting that the two \\nare quite different kinds of psychological state.\\nSo what are some putative grounds for denying that perceptual experience has \\nhigh-level content and that fail to apply to the imagination? Where, that is, is the \\nevidence for 2?\\n7 Peter Kung (2010, p. 625) outlines a framework for thinking about the imagination’s content on which \\nsome of its putative high-level content could be construed as in fact belonging to stipulation.')]\n"

Crucially, this thereby illustrates a difference in \\nthe representational nature of the imagination and perception, suggesting that we are \\ndealing with a difference in kind and not degree.\\n4  Perceptualism and\\xa0cognitive penetration\\nReflecting on the high-level content debate is not the only way that we can drive \\na wedge between imagination and perceptual experience. We can also do so via \\nreflecting on the question of whether perceptual experience is cognitively penetra-\\nble. This is the matter of whether non-perceptual states like belief, desire, etc. ever \\nproduce a direct affect upon perceptual content. Those who claim that perceptual \\nexperience is cognitively penetrable claim that it can. Those who deny the cognitive \\npenetrability thesis claim that the effect of cognitive states on perception is either \\npre-perceptual, determining, e.g., the spatial allocation of perceptual attention, or \\nelse is post-perceptual, determining, e.g., what beliefs one is disposed to form on the \\nbasis of perceptual experience (Pylyshyn, 1999).\\nBy way of illustration, consider the following: in experimental conditions, sub-\\njects who were led to believe that samples of meat originated from factory-farmed \\nanimals rated them as tasting saltier than did subjects who were led to believe that \\nidentical samples originated from humanely-farmed animals (Anderson & Barrett, \\n2016). Question: in the first group, did their belief that the meat samples were from \\nfactory farmed animals literally make the meat taste saltier than it would have oth-\\nerwise? Those who affirm the cognitive penetrability thesis reply ‘yes’, those who \\ndeny it claim ‘no’. The naysayers will reply that the belief about the meat’s origin \\neither altered how those in the first group allocated their gustatory attention, e.g., \\ncausing them to selectively pick up on properties that they wouldn’t have otherwise, \\nor else the belief induced by the experimenters disposed members of the group \\nto judge the samples particularly salty, with gustatory experience itself uniform \\nbetween the two groups.\\nLike the question of whether perception has high-level content, the question of \\nperception’s cognitive penetrability is controversial. Many experimental studies \\nadvanced as evidence of cognitive penetration seem poorly designed, either suffer -\\ning failures of replicability or else having been found vulnerable to interference or \\ntask-demand effects (Firestone & Scholl, 2016; Machery, 2015). Crucially, intro-\\nspective evidence is of little help to adjudicate matters here. Introspection lacks the \\nkeenness to distinguish cognition’s affecting either (1) the pre-perceptual alloca-\\ntion of attention; (2) perceptual content itself (i.e. cognitive penetration); (3) what \\n11 Compare Tim Bayne (2009, p. 395): “It does not matter what one believes about an object; it still \\nlooks like a pipe, a stethoscope, or a cigarette lighter.”.'),\n",

Our visual systems are \\n“tuned” (p. 142) to the comings and goings of colour, shape, motion, etc. but not the \\ngenetic essences constitutive of natural kinds; visual phenomenology, in the normal \\ncourse of things, changes in the face of variations to the former but not the latter. \\nIndeed, it seems that one’s visual phenomenology would fail to differ between a sit-\\nuation in which tigers were before one’s eyes and a situation in which twigers were \\ninstead present. (Twigers, we may suppose, are creatures that happen to share\\xa0 all \\nlow-level properties with tigers while being a distinct species.) If this is right, then \\nobjects that are look-alikes in terms of low-level properties should be considered \\nlook-alikes simpliciter, leaving no room for high-level properties to figure in per -\\nceptual content. Again, however, this worry has no analogue in the case of mental \\nimagery that would prevent such states from representing high-level properties. I \\ntake this to be further evidence of a representational difference between the two.\\nHere’s why the worry doesn’t carry over to the imagination. In the case of per -\\nception, high-level properties are either represented in the same bottom-up, stimu-\\nlus-driven way that low-level properties like colour, shape, motion, etc. are, or (as is \\nmore likely) as a matter of cognitive penetration, i.e. a top-down effect of standing \\nbeliefs, desires, expectations, etc. on perception (more on that later). In either case, \\nhowever, perception comes to represent high-level properties in an involuntary man-\\nner. Although cognitive penetration involves acquired cognitive contents altering \\nperceptual contents, such effects on perception are largely automatic, involving an \\nunwilled ‘leaking’ of such contents into perception.9\\nWith states of the imagination, things are different. When Tye complains that the \\nvisual system is insufficiently ‘tuned’ to the genetic essence constitutive of natural \\nkinds in order to represent such properties, this is not a problem in the case of the \\nimagination. For, regardless of whether the imagination sometimes acquires content \\nfrom causal interactions with the environment in the bottom-up way that percep-\\ntion typically does, there is another manner by which the imagination can acquire \\ncontent, and which is unavailable to perception, at least in the case of representing \\nnatural kinds: by being responsive to one’s intention to represent such-and-such a \\nnatural kind. For instance, I can imagine two suitably-striped creatures side-by-side, \\nrepresent the creature on the left to be a tiger, the one on the right to be a twiger, \\nand then reverse this as I please. Similarly, I can imagine two glasses of clear liq-\\nuid next to one another, and represent one to be water, composed of  H2O, and the \\nother to be twater, composed of XYZ; I can again freely reverse this assignation as \\nI choose, or refrain from doing so. This might be thought to involve an accompany -\\ning propositional imagining acting on the image content, a form of imagining I have \\nclaimed can be put aside. However, given that the relevant propositional imagining \\nwould itself acquire content from a suitable\\xa0“content-conveying intention” (Noord-\\nhoff, 2002, p. 430), it is not clear why propositional imagining must be appealed to \\nhere and why intention shouldn’t be pictured as acting directly on imagery content.\\n9 An exception might be when mental imagery is voluntarily projected into perception, as in the driving \\nexample, though such projection can also occur involuntarily.'),\n",

This is not the result that one should get, if percep-\\ntualism is true. For instance, suppose you are driving at night in foggy conditions \\nalong a narrow road. Thankfully, no other cars are out. Still, the route is precarious. \\nSuddenly, a car appears on the road. At least, you assume it to be one; all you can \\nvisually discern are two headlights. To work out whether there is space for the cars \\nto pass on the narrow lane, you must make an educated guess as to the shape of \\nthe other car, given the position of the headlights. But you need to do so in such a \\nway that can directly guide your action. Solution: you imaginatively project, out into \\nthe pitch-black, the outline shape of a car that strikes you as being the correct size. \\n(Whether this is a matter of representing only low-level properties, i.e. those corre-\\nsponding to the outline shape of the car, or is also or instead a matter of representing \\nhigh-level properties, i.e. the shape to be that of a car part, doesn’t matter.)\\nSuppose, however, that you get the proportions disastrously wrong (and so crash). \\nThen, the image projected was in error. The error is in terms of the properties your \\nmental imagery represented as instantiated in the external world. If imaginative \\nstates are of a kind with perceptual states, then this would be a case of illusion, or \\nat least something very close to it. Yet one would not speak here of a visual illusion \\nor of a mis-seeing of the car’s shape. (The problem was precisely that you couldn’t \\nvisually experience these properties!) Thus, supposing that there are no perceptual \\nillusions of high-level properties, this fact may threaten high-level views of percep-\\ntual content, but not high-level views of the imagination’s content (no more, at least, \\nthan the idea that belief can represent such properties). When imagery misrepresents \\nproperties in the world, as when belief misrepresents such properties, ‘illusion’ is \\nnot the word to begin with. Thus, populating the imagination with high-level content \\ndoes not, while populating perception with such content does, have relevance for the \\nscope of perceptual illusions. This shows a significant difference in the representa-\\ntional nature of perceptual experience and mental imagery.\\n3.2  Doppelgangers\\nAnother key reason for resisting the claim that perceptual experience has high-level \\ncontent, but which has no analogue in the case of mental imagery, concerns percep-\\ntual doppelgangers. This argument can be pressed a number of ways (Bayne, 2009 \\ndiscusses several variants). A simple version is presented by Michael Tye:\\nIt seems plausible to suppose that the property of being a tiger is not itself a \\nfeature represented [perceptually]. Our sensory states do not track this feature. \\nThere might conceivably be creatures other than tigers that look to us phenom-\\nenally just like tigers. (1995, p.141)'),\n",

He continues:\\n[O]ne may imagine the piano being made of ice, being the offspring of Mr. \\nand Mrs. Truman, turning into a butterfly and flying up the stairs, or whatever. \\n(Ibid.)\\n I will grant, for the sake of argument, Byrne’s assumption that the imagination has \\nhigh-level content.7 My strategy for arguing against perceptualism will be on the \\nbasis of some aspects of the high-level content debate itself.\\nThe argument from high-level content\\n1. If perceptualism is true, then putative grounds for denying that perceptual expe-\\nrience has high-level content are putative grounds for denying that states of the \\nimagination have high-level content.\\n2. Putative grounds for denying that perceptual experience has high-level content \\nare not putative grounds for denying that states of the imagination have high-level \\ncontent.\\n3. Perceptualism is not true.\\nI take 1 to be entailed by perceptualism. If states of the imagination are a proper \\nsubset of perceptual experience, then challenges facing a high-level view of percep-\\ntual content will, ipso facto, be challenges for a high-level view of the imagination’s \\ncontent. Whether those challenges are only prima facie or are instead sufficient \\ngrounds for rejecting the high-level view of perception won’t concern me. (Hence \\nI call them only putative grounds.) Premise 2 says that challenges to perception’s \\nhaving high-level content have no application to imagination’s having high-level \\ncontent. If true, this seems evidence of a substantial asymmetry between perception \\nand imagination, one that does not constitute a mere difference in degree, but a dif-\\nference in kind; specifically, it points to a difference in representational natures. The \\nconclusion is that perceptualism is false: states of the imagination, mental imagery \\nin particular, are not a subset of perceptual experience; the two are not on a\\xa0substan-\\ntial continuum with one another nor members of the same fundamental psychologi-\\ncal kind (though they may of course share many properties in common). In sum, I \\nargue below that challenges to perception’s having high-level content have no rel-\\nevance as to whether the imagination has high-level content, suggesting that the two \\nare quite different kinds of psychological state.\\nSo what are some putative grounds for denying that perceptual experience has \\nhigh-level content and that fail to apply to the imagination? Where, that is, is the \\nevidence for 2?\\n7 Peter Kung (2010, p. 625) outlines a framework for thinking about the imagination’s content on which \\nsome of its putative high-level content could be construed as in fact belonging to stipulation.')]"
